In this paper, we explore the concept of time within Bitcoin's blockchain, which operates as a non-continuous time system. We focus on three core aspects that contribute to Bitcoin's time discontinuity: the random and distributed block generation process, the occurrence of forks and rollbacks that disrupt the linear progression of the blockchain, and the nature of transactions within this system, which are subject to potential reordering or invalidation. These elements combine to create a time structure in Bitcoin that is fundamentally different from the continuous, linear time systems typically seen in traditional computing and physics. Additionally, the implications of this non-continuous time model for the future of decentralized technologies and their potential applications are discussed.
Cryptocurrencies have recently been in the spotlight of public debate due to their embrace by the new US President, with crypto fans expecting a 'bull run'. The global cryptocurrency market capitalisation is more than $3.50 trillion, with 1 Bitcoin exchanging for more than $97,000 at the end of November 2024. Monitoring the evolution of these systems is key to understanding whether the popular perception of cryptocurrencies as a new, sustainable economic infrastructure is well-founded. In this paper, we have reconstructed the network structures and dynamics of Bitcoin from its launch in January 2009 to December 2023 and identified its key evolutionary phases. Our results show that network centralisation and wealth concentration increased from the very early years, following a richer-get-richer mechanism. This trend was endogenous to the system, beyond any subsequent institutional or exogenous influence. The evolution of Bitcoin is characterised by three periods, Exploration, Adaptation and Maturity, with substantial coherent network patterns. Our findings suggest that Bitcoin is a highly centralised structure, with high levels of wealth inequality and internally crystallised power dynamics, which may have negative implications for its long-term sustainability.
The advent of Quantum Computing (QC) poses significant threats to the cryptographic foundations of Blockchain (BC) systems, as quantum algorithms like Shor's and Grover's undermine the security of public-key cryptography and hash functions. This research conducts a comprehensive risk assessment of quantum vulnerabilities across critical BC components, including consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and digital wallets. Leveraging the STRIDE threat modeling framework, we analyze threat vectors specific to QC, identifying key areas most susceptible to quantum-enabled attacks, such as private key compromise, consensus disruptions, and smart contract integrity risks. Our contributions provide actionable recommendations and mitigation strategies, including a detailed security blueprint for quantum resilience, encompassing post-quantum cryptography, quantum-safe key exchange protocols, and quantumresistant hash functions. We offer best practices for implementation, focusing on key management, secure coding, and network security to strengthen BC components against quantum threats. To mitigate the risk of QC during the transition period from classical to quantum-resistant BCs, we present two hybrid BC architectures. As part of a comprehensive quantum resilience strategy, these architectures facilitate a secure and scalable migration by integrating platform-specific adaptations that balance security, adaptability, and operational efficiency. Our analysis extends to major BC platforms, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Zcash, providing platform-specific vulnerability assessments and highlighting unique weaknesses in the quantum era. By identifying vulnerabilities, developing proactive defense strategies, and adopting a structured hybrid migration approach, this research equips BC stakeholders with a robust framework to achieve long-term security and resilience against emerging quantum threats. Finally, we delve into the challenges and research directions associated with integrating emerging technologies, including quantum machine learning, artificial intelligence, and Web3, with BC systems, and discuss the new threats that may arise from this convergence in the QC era.
In this paper, we introduce and implement BRC20 sniping attack. Our attack manipulates the BRC20 token transfers in open markets and disrupts the fairness among bidding participants. The longstanding principle of "highest bidder wins" is rendered ineffective. Typically, open BRC20 token markets rely on Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) to broadcast selling intents and wait for buying auctions. Our attack targets the BRC20 buying process (i.e., transfer) by injecting a front-running transaction to complete the full signature of the PSBT. At its core, the attack exploits the mempool's fee-based transaction selection mechanism to snipe the victim transaction, replicate metadata, and front-run the legesmate transction. This attack applies to platforms using PSBT for BRC20 token transfers, including popular Bitcoin exchanges and marketplaces (e.g., Magic Eden, Unisat, Gate.io, OKX). We implemented and tested the attack on a Bitcoin testnet (regtest), validating its effectiveness through multiple experimental rounds. Results show that the attacker consistently replaces legitimate transactions by submitting higher-fee PSBTs. We have also made responsible disclosures to the mentioned exchanges.
In blockchain-based order book systems, buyers and sellers trade assets, while it is miners to match them and include their transactions in the blockchain. It is found that many miners behave selfishly and myopically, prioritizing transactions with high fees and ignoring many desirable matches that could enhance social welfare. Existing blockchain mechanisms fail to address this issue by overlooking miners' selfish behaviors. To our best knowledge, this work presents the first analytical study to quantify and understand buyer and seller transaction fee choices and selfish miners' transaction matching strategies, proving an infinitely large price of anarchy (PoA) for social welfare loss. To mitigate this, we propose an adjustable block size mechanism that is easy to implement without altering the existing decentralized protocols and still allows buyers and sellers to freely decide transaction fees and miners to selfishly match. The analysis is challenging, as pure strategy Nash equilibria do not always exist, requiring the analysis of many buyers' or sellers' interactive mixed-strategy distributions. Moreover, the system designer may even lack information about each buyer's or seller's bid/ask prices and trading quantities. Nevertheless, our mechanism achieves a wellbounded PoA, and under the homogeneous-quantity trading for non-fungible tokens (NFT), it attains a PoA of 1 with no social welfare loss. We implement our mechanism on a local instance of Ethereum to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Experiments based on the realistic dataset demonstrate that our mechanism achieves social optimum for homogeneous-quantity trading like NFT. It can enhance social welfare up to 3.7 times compared to the existing order book benchmarks for heterogeneous-quantity trading of Bitcoin tokens. It exhibits robustness against random variations in buyers and sellers.
Digital currencies have become popular in the last decade due to their nondependency and decentralized nature. The price of these currencies has seen a lot of fluctuations at times, which has increased the need for prediction. As their most popular, Bitcoin(BTC) has become a research hotspot. The main challenge and trend of digital currencies, especially BTC, is price fluctuations, which require studying the basic price prediction model. This research presents a classification and regression model based on stack deep learning that uses a wavelet to remove noise to predict movements and prices of BTC at different time intervals. The proposed model based on the stacking technique uses models based on deep learning, especially neural networks and transformers, for one, seven, thirty and ninety-day forecasting. Three feature selection models, Chi2, RFE and Embedded, were also applied to the data in the pre-processing stage. The classification model achieved 63% accuracy for predicting the next day and 64%, 67% and 82% for predicting the seventh, thirty and ninety days, respectively. For daily price forecasting, the percentage error was reduced to 0.58, while the error ranged from 2.72% to 2.85% for seven-to ninety-day horizons. These results show that the proposed model performed better than other models in the literature.
This paper proposes a method of emulation of OP_RAND opcode on Bitcoin through a trustless interactive game between transaction counterparties. The game result is probabilistic and doesn't allow any party to cheat and increase their chance to win on any protocol step. The protocol can be organized in a way unrecognizable to any external party and doesn't require some specific scripts or Bitcoin protocol updates. We will show how the protocol works on the simple Thimbles Game and provide some initial thoughts about approaches and applications that can use the mentioned approach.
A smart contract is an interactive program that governs funds in the realm of a single cryptocurrency. Yet, the many existing cryptocurrencies have spurred the design of crosschain applications that require interactions with multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously. Currently, cross-chain applications are implemented as use-case-specific cryptographic protocols that serve as overlay to synchronize smart contract executions in the different cryptocurrencies. Hence, their design requires substantial expertise, as well as a security analysis in complex cryptographic frameworks. In this work, we present BitML x , the first domain-specific language for cross-chain smart contracts, enabling interactions with several users that hold funds across multiple Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies. We contribute a compiler to automatically translate a BitML x contract into one contract per involved cryptocurrency and a user strategy that synchronizes the execution of these contracts. We prove that an honest user, who follows the prescribed strategy when interacting with the several contracts, ends up with at least as many funds as in the corresponding execution of the BitML x contract. Last, but not least, we implement the BitML x compiler and demonstrate its utility in the design of illustrative examples of cross-chain applications such as multi-chain donations or loans across different cryptocurrencies.
Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions heavily rely on opaque, black-box models. These lack interpretability and adaptability, failing to effectively capture behavioral patterns. Many researchers, including us, believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bridge this gap due to their robust reasoning abilities for complex tasks. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to realworld cryptocurrency transaction graphs, specifically within the Bitcoin network. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm, CETraS, which simplifies larger transaction graphs. Experimental results show that LLMs excel at foundational metrics and offer detailed characteristic overviews. Their effectiveness in contextual interpretation suggests they can provide useful explanations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data.

Transaction fee prediction in Bitcoin's ecosystem represents a crucial challenge affecting both user costs and miner revenue optimization. This study presents a systematic evaluation of six predictive models for forecasting Bitcoin transaction fees across a 24-hour horizon (144 blocks): SARIMAX, Prophet, Time2Vec, Time2Vec with Attention, a Hybrid model combining SARIMAX with Gradient Boosting, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our approach integrates comprehensive feature engineering spanning mempool metrics, network parameters, and historical fee patterns to capture the multifaceted dynamics of fee behavior. Through rigorous 5-fold cross-validation and independent testing, our analysis reveals that traditional statistical approaches outperform more complex deep learning architectures. The SARIMAX model achieves superior accuracy on the independent test set, while Prophet demonstrates strong performance during cross-validation. Notably, sophisticated deep learning models like Time2Vec and TFT show comparatively lower predictive power despite their architectural complexity. This performance disparity likely stems from the relatively constrained training dataset of 91 days, suggesting that deep learning models may achieve enhanced results with extended historical data. These findings offer significant practical implications for cryptocurrency stakeholders, providing empirically-validated guidance for fee-sensitive decision making while illuminating critical considerations in model selection based on data constraints. The study establishes a foundation for advanced fee prediction while highlighting the current advantages of traditional statistical methods in this domain.
